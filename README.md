# snRNA-seq Analysis – TRPV1-Independent and Sex-Specific Capsaicin Signatures in *Drosophila*

This repository contains the **single-nucleus RNA-seq** (snRNA-seq) analysis pipeline from our brief report on how *Drosophila melanogaster*, a TRPV1-lacking species, responds to dietary capsaicin.

---

## Summary

- **Samples:** Pooled brains from female and male flies collected between ZT6–ZT12 after capsaicin or control diets.
- **44 annotated cell-type clusters**
- **Sex-specific responses:**
  - **Females:** Broader transcriptional changes, modulation of insulin-producing cells, TGF-β and AstA signaling in learning/memory circuits.
  - **Males:** WNT, NPF, and Dh31 pathways; reduced dopaminergic transcriptomic engagement.
- **Glial involvement:** Astrocytes, cortex glia, and ensheathing glia show strong responses linked to circadian and sleep regulation.

Raw data deposited at **X**.
